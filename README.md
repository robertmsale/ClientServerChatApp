# Computer Networking
## Client-Server Chat Application
___
This is a *nix implementation of Computer Networking Chat App Project

#### Rubric code
* `SocketEntity.h/cpp` Shared socket logic between client and server
* `Client.h/cpp` Client socket logic
* `Server.h/cpp` Server socket logic
* `Logger.h/cpp` Logging messages to file

All other sources tie the project together but don't necessarily deal with sockets.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies for successful build:

1. Homebrew (`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`) or equivalent package manager for *nix system
2. CMake (`brew install cmake` or `sudo apt install cmake` or equivalent)
3. Xcode command line tools (Mac) or `build-essentials` package (Ubuntu) or equivalent 
4. `ninja` build tool

Optionally, but highly recommended, `tmux`.

## Build

### Convenient method

From the same directory as this README, execute:
```bash
./build-and-start.sh # [build folder] [session name] <- optionals
```

This will build the project using CMake and fire up a tmux session with 1 server (port 33420) and 2 client panes automatically. It also enables mouse control for tmux to make it *even easier* 😁 also by running this script, if you detach `CTRL+b d` from the session it will automatically kill the session for you. 

If `tmux` is not installed it will skip that part entirely.

### From Scratch

From the same directory as this README perform the following steps:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=ninja -G Ninja -S $PWD/..
cmake --build ./ --target all -j 4 # or however many number of CPU cores you want to use
```

## IMPORTANT NOTE

Because this program disables echo and canonical input on stdin, using `CTRL+C` does not work, so running these in their own tmux session is highly recommended so you can `CTRL+b x y` to terminate the program in case a deadlock occurs. Or if running from the convenient build script just detaching will kill the processes.

## Special Considerations

In `pch.h` there is `using SocketSizeType = char;`. What's special about this is if you change it to another integer type it will automatically alter the TCP send and receive methods in the client and the server. Currently the max message size is 255 because it's a `char`, but setting it to `short` will raise the max message size to 65535 and the partial message loop will read two bytes instead of just one 🤓.
